# Sufficiency of the 66-Book Canon: Perspectives from Key Theologians

This document considers the likely, logical, and actual perspectives of Billy Graham, Chris Platt, Charles Spurgeon, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, D.L. Moody, Chuck Swindoll, J.C. Ryle, R.C. Sproul, and S.M. Lockridge regarding the sufficiency of the traditional 66-book Protestant Bible canon versus a canon including additional books (Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical, totaling 72 or 73 books).

## Core Protestant Position

The foundational argument for the 66-book canon from a Protestant perspective rests on:

1.  **The Hebrew Canon (Tanakh):** The Old Testament of the Protestant Bible aligns with the canon of Hebrew Scripture recognized by Judaism at the time of Jesus and the early church.
2.  **New Testament Witness:** Jesus and the Apostles quoted extensively from the Old Testament books found in the 66-book canon, treating them as authoritative Scripture. They did *not* quote the Apocryphal books as Scripture, though they may have alluded to them or been familiar with the stories.
3.  **Early Church Fathers:** While some Church Fathers read and valued the Apocrypha for edification, many, like Jerome (translator of the Latin Vulgate), made a clear distinction between the canonical books (Hebrew canon) and the "ecclesiastical" books (Apocrypha), deeming the latter useful for reading but not for establishing doctrine.
4.  **Internal Evidence:** Protestants argue that some Apocryphal books contain historical inaccuracies, theological teachings inconsistent with the 66 canonical books (e.g., prayers for the dead, salvation by almsgiving), or do not claim divine inspiration in the same way.
5.  **Reformation Principle of `Sola Scriptura`:** Scripture alone is the ultimate authority for faith and practice. This led Reformers to reaffirm the 66-book canon. The Council of Trent (1546) was the Roman Catholic Church's official response, definitively declaring the Deuterocanonical books as inspired Scripture.

## Individual Perspectives

### 1. Billy Graham (Evangelist, Baptist roots)
*   **Likely/Actual:** Graham, as a pillar of 20th-century evangelicalism, would have unreservedly held to the sufficiency and sole authority of the 66-book canon. His entire ministry was based on preaching the Gospel from these accepted Scriptures. He relied on translations like the KJV and later the NIV, both of which contain the 66 books.
*   **Guidance:** The 66 books are God's complete and sufficient written revelation for salvation and Christian living.

### 2. Chris Platt (Assuming Chris Platt, a modern evangelical pastor/author, e.g., of "Radical")
*   **Likely/Logical:** As a contemporary conservative evangelical pastor and theologian, he would strongly affirm the 66-book canon as the inspired, inerrant, and sufficient Word of God. This is standard in such circles.
*   **Guidance:** Trust the 66 books as the divinely inspired and authoritative Word of God, sufficient for all matters of faith and life.

### 3. Charles Spurgeon (19th Century Baptist Preacher)
*   **Actual:** Spurgeon had an exceptionally high view of Scripture. He would have staunchly defended the 66-book Protestant canon. In his writings and sermons, his appeals to scriptural authority are always to these books. He would have viewed the Apocrypha as uninspired human writings.
    > "We, who are called Protestants, have had a great battle to fight for the purity of the canon of Scripture... We believe that the books which are commonly called the Apocrypha are not the Word of God, and are no more to be received as such than the writings of Josephus, or any other merely human author." (From a sermon on the "All-Sufficiency of Scripture").
*   **Guidance:** The 66 books alone are the inspired Word of God, perfect and sufficient. Do not add to or subtract from them.

### 4. Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Lutheran Pastor, Theologian)
*   **Likely/Actual:** This is the most nuanced. Lutherans traditionally hold a slightly different view of the Apocrypha than Calvinists or Baptists. Martin Luther included the Apocrypha in his German Bible translation, placing them between the Old and New Testaments with the note: *"Apocrypha: these are books not held equal to the Holy Scriptures and yet are profitable and good to read."*
    Bonhoeffer, deeply rooted in Lutheran tradition and with a profound love for Scripture, would likely have seen the 66 books as the primary canon for establishing doctrine. He might have acknowledged the Apocrypha's devotional or historical value as "good to read" but not as divinely inspired Scripture on par with the 66 books for doctrinal formulation.
*   **Guidance:** The 66 books are the foundation of Christian doctrine. Other ancient writings (like the Apocrypha) might offer some historical insight or devotional benefit but are not inspired Scripture in the same sense and should not be used to establish core doctrines.

### 5. D.L. Moody (19th Century Evangelist)
*   **Likely/Actual:** Moody was a pragmatic evangelist with a deep love for the Bible (typically the KJV). His focus was on the core message of salvation found within the 66 books. He would have accepted the standard Protestant canon without question.
*   **Guidance:** The Bible (66 books) is God's Word. Read it, believe it, obey it, and share its saving message.

### 6. Chuck Swindoll (Contemporary Evangelical Pastor, Educator, Author)
*   **Actual:** Swindoll, as a prominent evangelical Bible teacher and former president of Dallas Theological Seminary, firmly upholds the 66-book canon as the inspired, inerrant, and sufficient Word of God. DTS's doctrinal statement is explicit on this.
*   **Guidance:** The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the divinely inspired Word of God, our sole infallible rule for faith and practice.

### 7. J.C. Ryle (19th Century Anglican Bishop, Evangelical)
*   **Actual:** Ryle, a staunch evangelical within the Church of England, would have adhered to Article VI of the 39 Articles: *"Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith..."* Article VI also lists the canonical books (the 66) and then mentions the Apocryphal books, stating the Church reads them *"for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine."*
*   **Guidance:** The 66 canonical books are the ultimate authority. The Apocrypha may be read for moral examples but not for establishing doctrine.

### 8. R.C. Sproul (Reformed Theologian, Founder of Ligonier Ministries)
*   **Actual:** Sproul was a formidable defender of `Sola Scriptura` and the inerrancy and authority of the 66-book canon. He wrote and spoke extensively on why the Protestant canon is the correct one, often detailing the historical and theological reasons for excluding the Apocrypha from inspired Scripture. He would have pointed to the lack of divine attestation, their absence from the Hebrew canon, and their non-use as Scripture by Jesus and the Apostles.
*   **Guidance:** The 66 books are the inspired and infallible Word of God, uniquely authoritative and sufficient. The Apocrypha lacks these credentials and should not be considered Scripture.

### 9. S.M. Lockridge (20th Century Baptist Pastor)
*   **Likely/Actual:** As a powerful Baptist preacher known for his high view of Christ and Scripture (e.g., "That's My King!"), Lockridge would undoubtedly have operated from and passionately defended the 66-book Protestant canon as the complete and sufficient Word of God. This is standard Baptist belief.
*   **Guidance:** The Bible (66 books) is God's holy, inerrant, authoritative Word. It's all we need.

## Summary of "Best Guidance" from these Perspectives

Overwhelmingly, these figures (with the slight nuance for Bonhoeffer due to Lutheran tradition) would guide you to:

1.  **Affirm the 66-book canon as uniquely inspired, authoritative, and sufficient Scripture.** These books are God-breathed and contain all that is necessary for knowing God, for salvation, and for living a life pleasing to Him.
2.  **Recognize the historical and theological reasons for this affirmation:**
    *   Alignment with the Hebrew canon recognized by Jesus.
    *   The pattern of quotation and use by Jesus and the Apostles.
    *   The careful discernment of the early church (even with regional variations before full consensus).
    *   The Reformation's reaffirmation based on `Sola Scriptura`.
3.  **View the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books as historically interesting and perhaps (for some, like Lutherans via Bonhoeffer, or Anglicans via Ryle) useful for moral example or devotional reading, but NOT as divinely inspired Scripture for establishing doctrine.** They are not on par with the 66 books.
4.  **Be wary of adding to Scripture.** The concept of a "closed canon" (that the canon of Scripture is complete with the 66 books) is central to their understanding.

Essentially, the guidance would be to trust the 66 books as the complete and final written Word of God, sufficient for all your spiritual needs, and to approach other writings, however historically significant, with a critical understanding that they do not carry the same divine authority.
