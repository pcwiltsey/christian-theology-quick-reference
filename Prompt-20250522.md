I have trouble keeping up with and remembering a lot of different biblical and church history terms and concepts.
Mostly is a problem because I need a quick reference for these concepts and how they relate to one another.

I was considering creating a Github repo with a several files for outlines and references in markdown format.
Would you please help me get started with that by helping me with a markdown outline containing an initial hierarchy that you think makes sense.
Please provide a one to three sentence concise definition for terms and place those terms where most appropriate in the outline.

If I list a term and neglect to mention obvious related terms, it definitely my own ignorance or forgetfulness.
Please include those related terms with the definition and organization considerations please.

I am planning to create the previously mentioned Github repo with this information, and I would like to frequently revisit and improve what is correlate and discuss.

Terms:
- Martin Luther
- John Calvin
- Calvinism
- Lutheranism
- Arminianism
- Episcopalian
- Congregational
- Lausanne Movement
- Lausanne Occasional Papers
- Protestant Reformation
- restoration plea
